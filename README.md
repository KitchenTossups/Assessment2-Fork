## Online Treasure Hunt:
[Github](https://www.github.com) - Gives us the ability to easily collaborate on the project itself, with easy version control and division of roles.<br/>
[Trello](https://www.trello.com) - Allows us to post, share, and organize tasks that need doing and issues that need resolving.<br/>
[LibGDX](https://www.libgdx.com) - It allows us to create something that fits the project specifications.<br/>
